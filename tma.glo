\glossaryentry{v1.19>!!=General:> PDF metadata (apparently) was solved with help from Steve Mayers; all down to the use of commands as string containers. New (\LaTeX  3) commands are robust and fail to expand within the context of the metadata and bookmarks; old (\LaTeX  2e) commands are fragile and correctly expanded. I have a mix of old commands and new variables now.|hdpindex{}}{9}
\glossaryentry{v1.18>!!=General:> PDF metadata doesn't set correctly so I have removed it: the cause is an incompatibility between \LaTeX  \ unicode and the PDF restricted character allowance.|hdpindex{}}{9}
\glossaryentry{v1.17>!!=General:> Rewritten with \LaTeX  3\ syntax from the `xparse' package to make commands less fragile. Finally, I got the alignment of part and subpart numbering to line up correctly.|hdpindex{}}{9}
\glossaryentry{v1.16>!!=General:> Added File Properties to pdf files using the hyperref setup system when in pdfbookmark mode.|hdpindex{}}{9}
\glossaryentry{v1.15>!!=General:> Define \cs  {setdate} and \cs  {thedate} to allow the header date to be used within the document, eg header and footer.|hdpindex{}}{9}
\glossaryentry{v1.14>!!=General:> Allow replacement of Question marker tag using \cs  {setquestionstring}. References with cleveref not working. Replaced my attempts at keeping \cs  {qpart} and \cs  {qsubpart} on the same line with Steve Mayers contribution.|hdpindex{}}{9}
\glossaryentry{v1.13>!!=General:> Arranged for \cs  {qsubpart} to go on the same line as the \cs  {qpart} when there is no intervening text \cs  {qsubpart} indents further than \cs  {qpart}.|hdpindex{}}{9}
\glossaryentry{v1.12>!!=General:> Standardized package name to 'tma' to make it compatible with CTAN. Avoided redefining standard \LaTeX  \ commands. Consolidated geometry settings. Adjusted loading order of packages. Improved code readability and comments. Added 'legacy' option to allow old definitions of \cs  {vec} and \cs  {C}.|hdpindex{}}{9}
